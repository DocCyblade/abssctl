# Session Log

#### How to use:
- This session log shall log all work performed in a work session.

- Work sessions will start with date/time then name for this the session followed by session status in (OPEN/CLOSED)
- New sessions are appended to file unless session is marked (OPEN) then we append to that session block
    - Be sure to start new session under the last sessions "-----------------------------------------"

- Each session block has it's own header and sub sections defined below
    - Starts with "# Date - [Session name] (OPEN/CLOSED)"
       - Session can be OPEN appended too, or CLOSED a new session needs to be started
       - All work will be detailed, one or two items per line
    - "## Wrap up: "
        - Wrap section is a summary of all lines lines logged. 
        - Can be written to on going or when we close the session
    - After the last line of of the wrap up block add a blank like followed up "-----------------------------------------" and two blank lines for the next session to appended too.
- Two blocks that are always at the bottom and keep a TODO and Primer for the next session are detailed below
    - "# Next Steps / TODO:"
        - This section is used to keep track in real time of whats to do next or if something is tabled for later it's written here for follow up. 
        - This should be written in real time and things moved from TODO to session log section
    - "# Next Session Primer"
        - Used for our AI chat friends to prime a new chat to get the chat up to speed on the project
        - this header floats at the bottom

-  Then list out items performed. When session is done write a Wrap up summary, a next steps section for quick next steps, and a AI prompt if working with with AI tools. Always append new sessions (do not edit prior sections).

# 2025-10-06 Alpha3 Session (CLOSED)
- Session continuing on branch dev-alpha3; prior session notes unavailable.
- Reviewed docs/requirements/abssctl-app-specs.txt (v1.0-draft-5) for v1 goals, scope, and roadmap.
- Summarised ADR-001 through ADR-032 decisions (Typer CLI, packaging to PyPI, TKL focus, filesystem layout, locking, TLS defaults, backup policy, doctor/CI strategy).
- Surveyed current Pre-Alpha code: Typer CLI scaffold with config/instance/version/backup groups, config loader merging defaults+YAML+env, state registry with atomic writes, npm version provider (cache-aware), placeholder instance status, and pytest coverage for these foundations.
- Renamed session log to `session-log.txt` per workflow update and introduced ROADMAP.md for milestone-aligned TODO tracking.
- Compiled ROADMAP.md capturing outstanding Alpha, Beta, RC, Release tasks plus optional future enhancements; added docs/roadmap.rst to expose the roadmap in the documentation set and left a pointer from ROADMAP.md.
- Linked docs/roadmap.rst into the Sphinx toctree (`docs/source/index.rst`), added a Sphinx-friendly wrapper at `docs/source/roadmap.rst`, and surfaced the document in README for easy discovery.
- Updated `make docs` to remove the previous `docs/_build/html` output before rebuilding to keep generated docs fresh.
- Ready for next implementation or review task.
- Implemented structured logging subsystem: introduced `StructuredLogger`, wired every CLI command (including `--version`) to emit human-readable and JSONL entries, ensured logs respect config `logs_dir`, and added pytest coverage for operations log creation.
- Hardened structured logging to degrade gracefully when log directories are read-only and resolved Sphinx/Ruff lint in support of the new subsystem.
- Relaxed structured logging type annotations to satisfy mypy (Literal return on `__exit__`, dictionary-based JSON types) and verified clean mypy/ruff/pytest runs from the project venv.
- Updated `make dist` pipeline: ensure `.venv-test` installs `.[dev]` and rebuilds when `pyproject.toml` or `Makefile` changes so mypy finds typer/rich stubs during CI-style builds.
- Adjusted `make quick-tests` to reuse the developer venv instead of deleting it, still re-running `pip install -e .[dev]` only when dependencies change.
- Designed and delivered the global + per-instance locking subsystem per ADR-027 (configurable timeout, flock metadata), integrated it with CLI placeholders, logging, and new tests validating timeouts and metadata.
- Introduced the templating engine per ADR-009/ADR-010: added configurable template directory, Jinja2-based renderer with override support, bundled systemd/nginx templates, and accompanying unit/CLI coverage.
- Prototyped the systemd provider: wired it to the template engine, added unit/management helpers, and captured behavior in dedicated tests to prepare for real instance lifecycle commands.
- Added the nginx provider scaffold with templated vhost rendering, symlink management, validation helpers, and focused tests.
- Integrated the systemd/nginx providers into `instance create` placeholder flow, generating service/vhost files, logging template steps, and ensuring safe runtime directories.
- Implemented instance lifecycle commands (enable/disable/start/stop/restart/delete) using the provider scaffolds, updated registry helper APIs, and covered the flows with CLI tests.

## Wrap Summary
- Built shared understanding of v1 scope by reviewing requirements and ADRs.
- Catalogued current Pre-Alpha implementation (CLI scaffold, config/state utilities, pytest coverage).
- Established roadmap tracking in `docs/roadmap.rst` and linked it across README and Sphinx docs.
- Improved `make docs` workflow to clean out old HTML artifacts before rebuilds.
- Delivered structured logging foundation with operations.jsonl + human logs and verified coverage.
- Implemented locking primitives and wired them into the CLI/runtime for future mutating commands.
- Shipped a templating engine foundation with built-in systemd/nginx templates and override support.
- Established the systemd and nginx provider scaffolds ready for CLI integration.

-----------------------------------------


# 2025-10-07 Alpha CI Session (CLOSED)
- Drafted a GitHub Actions workflow for publishing dev tags (``dev-*``) to TestPyPI and reviewed trusted publisher requirements for final rollout.
- Noted the need to append new session entries without altering previous logs.
- Converted ``publish-dev`` workflow to use PyPI trusted publishing (OIDC) for TestPyPI dev tags, removing the dependency on stored credentials and updating ``docs/roadmap.rst`` to mark the roadmap item complete.
- Ran ``make dist`` locally to mirror the workflow steps and confirm lint/type/test/build all pass on the current branch.
- Recorded the protected GitHub environment ``publish-dev`` with its approval gate (15 min timeout) and the new tag convention ``v*.*.*-dev``.
- Confirmed TestPyPI trusted publisher registration for ``DocCyblade/abssctl`` â†’ ``publish-dev.yml`` bound to the ``publish-dev`` environment.
- Addressed the CI failure caused by Metadata-Version 2.4 by pinning Hatch build targets to emit Core Metadata 2.3 (``pyproject.toml``) and rebuilding artifacts via ``make dist`` to verify.
- Authored ADR-033 defining the unified versioning/tagging strategy (PEP 440 package versions, ``v<version>`` release tags, ``v<version>-dev`` TestPyPI tags, and ``docs-v<version>`` documentation tags).
- Added explicit PEP 440 reference links to ADR-033 for clarity.
- Realigned GitHub Actions workflows with ADR-033: CI now reacts to ``v*``/``v*.*.*-dev``/``docs-v*`` tags, docs publishing validates ``docs-v`` tags against ``__version__``, dev publishes enforce version alignment + concurrency, and a new ``publish-release.yml`` promotes ``v<version>`` tags to PyPI via the ``publish-release`` environment.
- Updated the workflow tag validators to parse ``__version__`` via ``ast`` so version checks work without importing the package (fixes runner errors during ``publish-dev`` guard).
- Introduced ``buildtools/validate_tag_version.py`` and refactored all workflows to call it, keeping validation logic shared and the YAML cleaner.
- Brought the new tag validation helper into compliance with Ruff (sorted imports, docstrings, stderr messaging) so lint passes locally and in CI.

## Wrap Summary
- Dev-tag publishing now uses TestPyPI trusted publishing with the ``publish-dev`` environment guarding releases.
- Verified the CI workflow path locally via ``make dist`` to ensure build artifacts are healthy, recorded the new tag pattern, and confirmed metadata compatibility with PyPI tooling.
- GitHub workflows now enforce the standardized tag/version policy across CI, docs, dev, and release pipelines with environment approvals in the loop.
- Logging discipline reminder stands so we continue appending to open sessions only.

-----------------------------------------


# 2025-10-08 Alpha 4 Session (CLOSED)
- Opened new session on branch dev-alpha4; ready to tackle primer items from prior log.
- Highlighted first three priorities for this session: tooling directory consolidation, doc alignment, and systemd/nginx provider planning.
- Consolidated scripting utilities under `tools/`, removing the redundant `buildtools/` directory and updating CI/Makefile references.
- Refreshed README and Sphinx docs to reflect Alpha foundations (logging/locks/templates), current branch strategy, quickstart/developer guidance, and the real CLI behaviours; verified the updates with `make docs`.
- Documented Makefile convenience targets (quick-tests/docs/dist) in README and Sphinx guides so contributors can rely on the shared workflows.
- Drafted the Beta-oriented systemd/nginx provider implementation plan (`docs/source/guides/systemd-nginx-provider-plan.rst`) covering goals, roadmap, testing strategy, and dependencies.
- Outlined the mutating-command test strategy (`docs/source/guides/mutating-command-test-strategy.rst`) detailing coverage gaps, layered approach, and next testing actions.
- Authored ADR-034 defining repository branching, release, hotfix, and docfix workflows; updated README and developer guide to reference the policy, verified Sphinx build.
- Captured the version lifecycle implementation plan (`docs/source/guides/version-lifecycle-plan.rst`) to steer install/switch/uninstall development; linked into Sphinx docs and validated the build.
- Reorganized the Sphinx index into Overview, Getting Started, Implementation Plans, and Reference sections for clearer navigation; verified the docs build.
- Normalised `versions.yml` handling with new registry helpers (`get_version`, `upsert_version`, `remove_version`) and schema validation; added unit tests covering success/error paths.
- Added per-version locking support (`LockManager.version_lock`/`mutate_versions`) with accompanying tests to coordinate lifecycle operations safely.
- Introduced `VersionInstaller` abstraction for npm-driven installs (dry-run support, staging-to-final move, metadata capture) plus dedicated tests; verified `mypy` and `pytest` passing.
- Implemented `version install|switch|uninstall` commands using the new installer, locks, and registry helpers; added guardrails (e.g., prevent uninstalling the active version), metadata updates, and CLI tests covering install flows, symlink management, and uninstall safety checks.
- Replaced the placeholder `version check-updates` with real npm metadata comparisons, producing structured messages/JSON and new CLI tests for upgrades and remote-failure scenarios.
- Added restart policy handling to `version switch` (`--restart none|rolling|all`) with systemd stop/start integration and CLI coverage for each mode.
- Introduced safety prompts/flags for `version install|switch|uninstall` (backup reminders, `--no-backup`, `--backup-message`, `--yes`), extended CLI tests, and documented the options.

## Wrap up:
- Implemented version lifecycle commands with restart policies, safety prompts, registry updates, and CLI/unit tests; introduced real update detection, per-version locking, and a reusable installer; refreshed docs and tooling support. Session remains active.

-----------------------------------------

# 2025-10-11 Sprint 7 (CLOSED)
- Session kickoff per primer; focus on version integrity metadata capture across registry and CLI surfaces.
- Confirmed ai-large-message.txt is clear; proceeding with TODO to record npm shasum/tarball hashes.
- Logged multi-step plan in `ai-tasks.txt`, opened Sprint 7 session context.
- Surveyed registry/helpers/tests to confirm `integrity` shape and updated plan for npm shasum + tarball digest coverage.
- Implemented installer integrity extraction, registry/CLI normalization, and doc updates; refreshed unit/CLI tests to assert new fields.
- Ran `pytest`; collection failed because local environment lacks editable install for `abssctl`/`typer` (ModuleNotFoundError).
- Authored backup command implementation plan covering archive layout, locks, index schema, and CLI flags; added to Sphinx implementation guides.
- Rebuilt docs with `make docs` to validate the new plan renders cleanly.
- Delivered `backup create`: added backups registry helpers, tar/sha256 workflow, CLI options (`--message`, `--label`, `--out-dir`, `--compression`, `--json`, `--dry-run`), and unit/CLI coverage.
- Wired version install/switch/uninstall safety prompts to invoke real backups with pre-operation labels, ensuring locks avoid deadlocks.
- Refined restart handling to use explicit action plans (`restart.plan`), executing systemd stop/start sequences with enhanced logging and tests.
- Updated README, CLI reference, and guides to document backup behaviour and restart expectations; Sphinx build verified.
- Added regression tests for backup JSON payloads and backups registry helpers; ran full `pytest` + `make docs` cleanly.
- Implemented `backup list`/`backup show` with new registry helpers, CLI table/JSON outputs, and coverage; `make quick-tests` now passes on the expanded surface.
- Added `backup verify`/`backup prune`, checksum revalidation, retention policies, and supporting CLI/unit tests; integrated new backup metadata into instance/version listings and extended prompts to `instance delete`; refreshed docs and Sphinx build succeeded.
- Drafted immediate next steps to focus on documentation (user guide/ADR updates) and explore restore workflows for future iterations; make quick-tests + docs remain green.
- Marked Alpha 4 roadmap items as complete, documented remaining backup restore/reconcile scope, introduced the backup restore design plan, and shipped a placeholder `backup restore` command with CLI/docs/tests updates.

## Wrap up:

- Backup command and supporting registry/tests delivered; version operations now auto-run backups on accepted prompts, restart handling uses explicit plans, and documentation/tests updated.
- Added read-only backup management commands (list/show) with fresh tests to round out observability, keeping quick-tests green.
- Introduced full backup lifecycle scaffolding (verify/prune/restore design), updated roadmap/docs, and kept tests/docs passing for Alpha 4 Release 2.
