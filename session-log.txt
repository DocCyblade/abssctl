# Session Log

# How to use:
This session log shall log all work performed in a work session. Work sesson will start with date/time. Then list out items performed. When session is done write a Wrap up summary, a next steps section for quick next steps, and a AI prompt if working with with AI tools.

## 2025-10-06 Alpha3 Session
- Session continuing on branch dev-alpha3; prior session notes unavailable.
- Reviewed docs/requirements/abssctl-app-specs.txt (v1.0-draft-5) for v1 goals, scope, and roadmap.
- Summarised ADR-001 through ADR-032 decisions (Typer CLI, packaging to PyPI, TKL focus, filesystem layout, locking, TLS defaults, backup policy, doctor/CI strategy).
- Surveyed current Pre-Alpha code: Typer CLI scaffold with config/instance/version/backup groups, config loader merging defaults+YAML+env, state registry with atomic writes, npm version provider (cache-aware), placeholder instance status, and pytest coverage for these foundations.
- Renamed session log to `session-log.txt` per workflow update and introduced ROADMAP.md for milestone-aligned TODO tracking.
- Compiled ROADMAP.md capturing outstanding Alpha, Beta, RC, Release tasks plus optional future enhancements; added docs/roadmap.rst to expose the roadmap in the documentation set and left a pointer from ROADMAP.md.
- Linked docs/roadmap.rst into the Sphinx toctree (`docs/source/index.rst`), added a Sphinx-friendly wrapper at `docs/source/roadmap.rst`, and surfaced the document in README for easy discovery.
- Updated `make docs` to remove the previous `docs/_build/html` output before rebuilding to keep generated docs fresh.
- Ready for next implementation or review task.
- Implemented structured logging subsystem: introduced `StructuredLogger`, wired every CLI command (including `--version`) to emit human-readable and JSONL entries, ensured logs respect config `logs_dir`, and added pytest coverage for operations log creation.
- Hardened structured logging to degrade gracefully when log directories are read-only and resolved Sphinx/Ruff lint in support of the new subsystem.
- Relaxed structured logging type annotations to satisfy mypy (Literal return on `__exit__`, dictionary-based JSON types) and verified clean mypy/ruff/pytest runs from the project venv.
- Updated `make dist` pipeline: ensure `.venv-test` installs `.[dev]` and rebuilds when `pyproject.toml` or `Makefile` changes so mypy finds typer/rich stubs during CI-style builds.
- Adjusted `make quick-tests` to reuse the developer venv instead of deleting it, still re-running `pip install -e .[dev]` only when dependencies change.
- Designed and delivered the global + per-instance locking subsystem per ADR-027 (configurable timeout, flock metadata), integrated it with CLI placeholders, logging, and new tests validating timeouts and metadata.
- Introduced the templating engine per ADR-009/ADR-010: added configurable template directory, Jinja2-based renderer with override support, bundled systemd/nginx templates, and accompanying unit/CLI coverage.

### Wrap Summary
- Built shared understanding of v1 scope by reviewing requirements and ADRs.
- Catalogued current Pre-Alpha implementation (CLI scaffold, config/state utilities, pytest coverage).
- Established roadmap tracking in `docs/roadmap.rst` and linked it across README and Sphinx docs.
- Improved `make docs` workflow to clean out old HTML artifacts before rebuilds.
- Delivered structured logging foundation with operations.jsonl + human logs and verified coverage.
- Implemented locking primitives and wired them into the CLI/runtime for future mutating commands.
- Shipped a templating engine foundation with built-in systemd/nginx templates and override support.

### Next Steps / TODO
- Draft design/implementation plan for systemd/nginx providers in advance of Beta tasks.
- Evaluate test strategy expansion to cover upcoming mutating commands.

### Next Session Primer
Prompt: "We're on branch dev-alpha3 with logging, locking, and templating in place. Next step: prototype the systemd provider rendering pipeline using the new engine."
