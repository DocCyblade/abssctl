This file is used to help bootstrap AI help/chats to keep things consistent between chats and sessions please read this first and all files listed before starting. 

All new chats I will start with the below text
Start with: 
Hello AI Dev Partner, can I call you AL? :-) you can call me Ken. to get you up to speed and bootstrap this chat session please 
read the file ai-directives.txt this has all the info you need to get started.

AI Directives for chats for this repo/project

- Workflow should always be documentation centric. Documentation -> Code -> Write/Run CI Test (where we can) -> Debug -> Change in Code -> Add/Update Docs 
- Project Documentation should be kept in sync with any major rework or progress. Try and keep docs in check.
   - If docs located or type is not specified work with the developer to get that specified and into the correct specs documents 
- Large messages may be asked via a file called ai-large-message.txt. 
   - Be sure to only remove below the correct line once read.
   - On session startup check this file as it may have longer message for session startup
     - if file is blank (except for header) assume we have no longer message at startup 

- Base project specs located at docs/requirements/abssctl-app-specs.txt
    - Any changes to scope will need to be approved and this document updated with an ADR attched
- Architecture decision records (ADR) are under /docs/adrs
    - Any new function or deviation of specs or ADRs need a new ADR and approved by developers
- Roadmap file docs/roadmap.rst
    - List the road map for the project. This file should be used to check off when things are done, and be added to if things change issues are found and/or ADRs/scope changes. Changes should be approved by developer
- Session log to be updated in real time by AI at session-log.txt
    - How to read this and update this file is at the top of the file
    - When asked to "session recap" give me:
        - the session wrap up. If not written write it out in the log
        - Current followup/TODO/Next Steps, if not written write it to log. Should be always up to date
    - When asked to "close the session:
        - finish writing all non-written things down in log
        - change session from OPEN to CLOSED
        - Ensure Wrap up is complete
        - enure Next Steps/TODO list is completed
        - update/replace Next Session Primer
            - Next Session Primer - Is used to bootstrap the AI chat session. Should be what is next to be done, using the previous TODO in session log and roadmap.
- Project Documentation should be kept in sync with any major rework or progress. Try and keep docs in check. 
- Always confirm your next actions before changing files, once approved work can be done

- Basic AI workflow loop
   1. AI reads and understands current project status, opens or read existing session log
   2. AI reads session log, and roadmap files recommends next 3 - 6 steps
   3. User prompts AI:
      3a. confirms next step or another issues or topic, proceed to step 4
      3b. "wrap up session" or "session recap" - Wrap up the session. We may still proceed from here or close the session 
      3c. "close the session" or "end this session" - AI to confirm this action then proceed to close the session
   4. AI works and gives proposed solution, asking clarify questions where needed
   5. User confirms the proposed idea or asks clarifying questions
   6. if proposed solution confirmed
      6a. AI works the solution on project files
      6b. runs tests ruff/mypy/pytests to test changes, fixes issues found
      6c. AI updates any docs that need updated due to the change to keep docs in sync. Runs build test on docs to confirm docs build
      6c. AI presents summary of changes
   7. User will confirm changes and run own tests.
      7a. If errors or other issues found, user presents issues AI/user to repeat steps 4-7 until solved
      7b. If no errors, user will commit changes
   8. User informs AI that work looks good and changes have been committed
   9. AI will then check the to ensure work was committed and if not let user know, we loop to step 2


- Task State on Crash or Failure: AI, to help keep track of longer tasks for a request please use the ai-tasks.txt
   - Keep an eye on your session model memory. If getting close let me know so we can start a new session
   - This file is to help you and me abd you in case you crash or failure during multi file edits
   - On a large task or multi task processes write to this file the goals and the steps to take to get there
   - As things are done remove them from the file.
   - This will work as a state list so if there is a crash we can recover
   - this file should be empty (except the file header)
   - If there is tasks in here assume there was a crash an try and recover

Lets get started, once you have read and understand all the directives your first thing to do
- Tell me you read and understand the documents, list them if would like
- Read the Next Session Primer in the session-log.txt
    - If the last session is CLOSED read it and start a new session asking for the name of session
    - If the last session is OPEN read it and append to the session
- Go over the next steps specified in the primer prompt unless there are things in the ai-task.log
