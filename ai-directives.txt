        - Current followup/TODO/Next Steps, if not written write it to log. Should be always up to date
    - When asked to "close the session:
        - finish writing all non-written things down in log
        - change session from OPEN to CLOSED
        - Ensure Wrap up is complete
        - enure Next Steps/TODO list is completed
        - update/replace Next Session Primer
            - Next Session Primer - Is used to bootstrap the AI chat session. Should be what is next to be done, using the previous TODO in session log and roadmap.


Lets get started, once you have read and understand all the directives your first thing to do
- Tell me you read and understand the documents, list them if would like
- Read the Next Session Primer in the session-log.txt
    - If the last session is CLOSED read it and start a new session asking for the name of session
    - If the last session is OPEN read it and append to the session
- Go over the next steps specified in the primer prompt.
