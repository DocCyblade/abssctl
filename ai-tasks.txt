4. Deliver initial `doctor` command with environment/system probes (ADR-029).
   3. Build CLI surface (`doctor`, optional filters/verbosity) producing structured logs and exit status reflecting overall health.
   4. Create fake provider fixtures to simulate healthy/degraded states and write unit/CLI tests covering probe success/failure/dry-run.
   5. Document doctor usage, probe list, expected outputs, and integrate into roadmap/session log.

5. Flesh out automated tests for Beta features and idempotency guarantees.
   1. Inventory coverage gaps across TLS, backup restore/reconcile, doctor, and lifecycle commands; prioritise scenarios lacking idempotency/regression tests.
   2. Extend pytest fixtures (fake binaries, temp dirs, helper contexts) to support new integration scenarios efficiently.
   3. Add targeted tests ensuring repeated command execution is idempotent (double restore, repeated enable, TLS install reruns, etc.).
   4. Integrate slow/extended suites under markers so CI can run comprehensive checks while supporting quick local loops.
   5. Track coverage metrics (pytest --cov, mutation tests if feasible) and document remaining risks for future milestones.
