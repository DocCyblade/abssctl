3. Ensure mutating commands honour `--dry-run`, `--yes`, backup prompts, and exit-code taxonomy (ADR-013/016/025/026).
   1. Audit all mutating CLI commands to catalogue current behaviour vs ADR expectations (dry-run semantics, prompt messaging, exit codes).
   2. Introduce shared helpers/utilities to enforce consistent prompt handling, dry-run step recording, and error-to-exit-code mapping.
   3. Update commands to use helpers, guaranteeing no filesystem/provider calls occur during dry-run and that backup prompts respect `--yes`/`--no-backup`.
   4. Validate exit codes align with ADR-013 across success, user abort, provider failure, and config errors; update operations log context accordingly.
   5. Expand test coverage with scenarios for each command’s dry-run, confirmation, and error paths; add regression tests for exit codes.
   6. Refresh documentation/CLI reference to clarify non-interactive flags and exit code guarantees.

4. Deliver initial `doctor` command with environment/system probes (ADR-029).
   1. Define probe set (config sanity, port availability, systemd unit state, nginx validation, filesystem permissions) and output schema (JSON + human summary).
   2. Implement probe collection layer leveraging existing providers/registries, including error aggregation and severity classification.
   3. Build CLI surface (`doctor`, optional filters/verbosity) producing structured logs and exit status reflecting overall health.
   4. Create fake provider fixtures to simulate healthy/degraded states and write unit/CLI tests covering probe success/failure/dry-run.
   5. Document doctor usage, probe list, expected outputs, and integrate into roadmap/session log.

5. Flesh out automated tests for Beta features and idempotency guarantees.
   1. Inventory coverage gaps across TLS, backup restore/reconcile, doctor, and lifecycle commands; prioritise scenarios lacking idempotency/regression tests.
   2. Extend pytest fixtures (fake binaries, temp dirs, helper contexts) to support new integration scenarios efficiently.
   3. Add targeted tests ensuring repeated command execution is idempotent (double restore, repeated enable, TLS install reruns, etc.).
   4. Integrate slow/extended suites under markers so CI can run comprehensive checks while supporting quick local loops.
   5. Track coverage metrics (pytest --cov, mutation tests if feasible) and document remaining risks for future milestones.
