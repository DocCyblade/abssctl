4. Deliver initial `doctor` command with environment/system probes (ADR-029).
   6. Implement the probe catalogue per ADR-029 (env/config/state/fs/ports/systemd/nginx/tls/app/disk) and integrate with providers/registries.
   7. Extend fake provider/config fixtures to exercise real probe success/failure paths in unit and CLI tests.
   8. Refresh documentation/roadmap with the delivered probe coverage and remediation guidance.

5. Flesh out automated tests for Beta features and idempotency guarantees.
   1. Inventory coverage gaps across TLS, backup restore/reconcile, doctor, and lifecycle commands; prioritise scenarios lacking idempotency/regression tests.
   2. Extend pytest fixtures (fake binaries, temp dirs, helper contexts) to support new integration scenarios efficiently.
   3. Add targeted tests ensuring repeated command execution is idempotent (double restore, repeated enable, TLS install reruns, etc.).
   4. Integrate slow/extended suites under markers so CI can run comprehensive checks while supporting quick local loops.
   5. Track coverage metrics (pytest --cov, mutation tests if feasible) and document remaining risks for future milestones.
