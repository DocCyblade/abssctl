B2-6 – version check-updates CLI coverage
- Remote matches installed -> “up to date” message/JSON assertions.
- Remote lookup returning [] (no failure) -> “remote-unavailable” status path.

B2-7 – version list CLI fallback paths
- Simulate VersionProvider raising FileNotFoundError (missing npm) and confirm fallback to local data.
- Ensure malformed cache JSON degrades gracefully (still lists registry versions, exit 0).
