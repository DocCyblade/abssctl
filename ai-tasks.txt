B2-3 – version install CLI error handling
- CLI integration tests for already-registered version (rc=2, filesystem untouched).
- Inject installer error to validate rc=4 and logged error step.
- Dry-run with --set-current should mark deferred switch without touching symlink.
- Verify --no-backup path records backup.skip step and skips prompt/backup creation.

B2-4 – version switch CLI guard rails
- Cover invalid --restart input (rc=2) and message content.
- Unregistered version path (rc=2) via _switch_version guard.
- Missing install directory (rc=3) scenario to confirm messaging.
- Simulate SystemdError during restart to ensure provider_error -> rc=4 and step logging.

B2-5 – version uninstall CLI safety checks
- Unknown version (rc=2) before filesystem mutation.
- Verify in-use guard message lists sorted instances and prevents changes.
- Path-missing uninstall succeeds: registry entry removed, no filesystem.remove step logged.

B2-6 – version check-updates CLI coverage
- Remote matches installed -> “up to date” message/JSON assertions.
- Remote lookup returning [] (no failure) -> “remote-unavailable” status path.

B2-7 – version list CLI fallback paths
- Simulate VersionProvider raising FileNotFoundError (missing npm) and confirm fallback to local data.
- Ensure malformed cache JSON degrades gracefully (still lists registry versions, exit 0).
