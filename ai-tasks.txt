# This file to be used for AI long tasks. AI should use this file to keep track of 
#   long running or multi step tasks so in case of a crash or error AI can read This
#   file and try to recover where it was in the long task.

6. Implement `abssctl system init` bootstrap and recovery command.
   1. Update requirements/docs/roadmap/CLI reference once accepted.

5. Flesh out automated tests for Beta features and idempotency guarantees.
   1. Inventory coverage gaps across TLS, backup restore/reconcile, doctor, and lifecycle commands; prioritise scenarios lacking idempotency/regression tests.
   2. Extend pytest fixtures (fake binaries, temp dirs, helper contexts) to support new integration scenarios efficiently.
   3. Add targeted tests ensuring repeated command execution is idempotent (double restore, repeated enable, TLS install reruns, etc.).
   4. Integrate slow/extended suites under markers so CI can run comprehensive checks while supporting quick local loops.
   5. Track coverage metrics (pytest --cov, mutation tests if feasible) and document remaining risks for future milestones.
