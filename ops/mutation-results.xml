    <summary>Mutation run finished with 3,397 surviving mutants, 3,772 killed, 1,479 timeouts, and 109 lines marked "no tests" (mutation score ~41%).</summary>
    <detail>
      <bullet>Survivors concentrated in `abssctl.cli` (doctor helpers), `abssctl.doctor` aggregation, `abssctl.tls` inspector, and bootstrap discovery; these areas need targeted tests.</bullet>
      <bullet>Large number of timeouts in `abssctl.config`, `abssctl.cli`, and `abssctl.logging`; consider trimming mutation scope or optimising slow tests before CI integration.</bullet>
      <bullet>Raw mutmut artifacts were reviewed during the pilot and then discarded to keep the workspace tidy; this summary captures the key findings.</bullet>
