# Session Log

#### How to use:
- This session log shall log all work performed in a work session.

- Work sessions will start with date/time then name for this the session followed by session status in (OPEN/CLOSED)
- New sessions are appended to file unless session is marked (OPEN) then we append to that session block
    - Be sure to start new session under the last sessions "-----------------------------------------"

- Each session block has it's own header and sub sections defined below
    - Starts with "# Date - [Session name] (OPEN/CLOSED)"
       - Session can be OPEN appended too, or CLOSED a new session needs to be started
       - All work will be detailed, one or two items per line
    - "## Wrap up: "
        - Wrap section is a summary of all lines lines logged. 
        - Can be written to on going or when we close the session
    - After the last line of of the wrap up block add a blank like followed up "-----------------------------------------" and two blank lines for the next session to appended too.
- When adding to an open session, add a local time stamp like "MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS: ", ensuring new entries append under the last one.
- Two blocks that are always at the bottom and keep a TODO and Primer for the next session are detailed below
    - "# Next Steps / TODO:"
        - This section is used to keep track in real time of whats to do next or if something is tabled for later it's written here for follow up. 
        - This should be written in real time and things moved from TODO to session log section
    - "# Next Session Primer"
        - Used for our AI chat friends to prime a new chat to get the chat up to speed on the project
        - this header floats at the bottom

-  Then list out items performed. When session is done write a Wrap up summary, a next steps section for quick next steps, and a AI prompt if working with with AI tools. Always append new sessions (do not edit prior sections).
- When the session log gets too big and/or the focus shifts, move older sessions to ``ops/archived-session-logs.txt`` (newest to oldest) so this file only carries the current working set.

# 2025-11-08 1108 Sprint 1 (OPEN)
- 11/08/2025 14:10:00: Session opened under the new directives; focus is finishing the v1.0.0 roadmap items (doctor --fix, support bundle, exit-code polish, mutation scope, docs packaging, completions).
- 11/08/2025 14:15:00: Reviewed the latest scoped mutmut run (2,016 survivors; CLI 1,262 / doctor probes 623 / doctor engine/models 33 / TLS 166; 532 timeouts) and confirmed only those subsystems need mutation coverage; docs/roadmap/test-coverage report updated accordingly.
- 11/08/2025 15:30:00: Re-read ops/ai-directives + ops/ai-tasks to recover context for 1108 Sprint 1, confirming outstanding mutation-testing follow-ups.
- 11/08/2025 15:32:00: Reviewed ops/node-compat-plan.md per primer so Node wrapper + compatibility deliverables stay front-of-mind before tackling `doctor --fix`.
- 11/08/2025 15:40:00: Surveyed existing Node references (ADR-018 warn-only policy, specs/roadmap) to prep for the new compatibility automation + wrapper work so updates stay consistent.
- 11/08/2025 15:55:00: Implemented `tools/list-sync-versions.py` to pull @actual-app/sync-server metadata from npm and seed `docs/requirements/node-compat.yaml` with the most recent stable releases + Node baseline rows.
- 11/08/2025 16:05:00: Extended the script to auto-render `docs/requirements/node-compatibility.rst` and updated the specs/roadmap to point at the YAML source-of-truth and refresh workflow.
- 11/08/2025 16:15:00: Ran `make quick-tests` (ruff, mypy, pytest) to lock in the new tooling/docs without regressions.

## Wrap up:
- (in progress)

-----------------------------------------

# Next Steps / TODO:
0. Read `ops/node-compat-plan.md` for the active Node compatibility/`n` wrapper tasks before picking up other roadmap items.
1. Ship ``doctor --fix`` auto-remediation (state dir repair, permission cleanup, lock pruning) with dry-run/telemetry plus wrap-up docs/tests.
2. Implement the support-bundle command (collection, redaction, size limits) and document secure hand-off workflows.
3. Harden CLI exit-code/error mapping to align with ADR-013, expanding regression tests + user messaging.
4. Close out targeted mutation survivors (CLI doctor helpers, doctor engine/probes, TLS inspector/validator) and keep the scoped mutmut suite stable.
5. Build the docs packaging pipeline: generate/publish man pages via CI and add ``abssctl docs man install|path`` helpers.
6. Add shell completion management (show/install/uninstall for bash/zsh/fish) with packaged scripts and tests.

# Next Session Primer
- Start by reviewing `ops/node-compat-plan.md` so the Node/runtime tasks stay front-of-mind, then design/implement ``doctor --fix`` auto-remediation (state dir/permissions/locks) before rolling directly into the support-bundle CLI work.
