# This file to be used for AI long tasks. AI should use this file to keep track of 
#   long running or multi step tasks so in case of a crash or error AI can read This
#   file and try to recover where it was in the long task.

# B3-3 – Pilot mutation testing
# - Mutmut run completed (`PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/tests:$(pwd)/src mutmut run`); score ~41% (3772 killed / 3397 survived / 1479 timeouts).
# - Mutmut re-run complete (survivors 2,816; timeouts 1,402). CLI/doctor/TLS helpers now have focused unit tests; next priority is planning and executing timeout mitigation for config/cli/logging/tls before the next mutmut run.
# - Investigate timeouts (heavy concentration in abssctl.config/cli/logging) before considering CI integration; possibly limit scope or mark slow tests.
