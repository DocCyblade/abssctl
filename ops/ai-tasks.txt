# B3-3 – Pilot mutation testing
# - Mutmut run completed (`PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/tests:$(pwd)/src mutmut run`); score ~41% (3772 killed / 3397 survived / 1479 timeouts).
# - Next: re-run mutmut after adding targeted CLI doctor helper, TLS, discovery, and logging tests to confirm survivor reduction and identify any remaining hotspots.
# - Investigate timeouts (heavy concentration in abssctl.config/cli/logging) before considering CI integration; possibly limit scope or mark slow tests.
